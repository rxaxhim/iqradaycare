                    We take the well-being of your child very seriously and work hard to provide an environment that is as healthy as possible. We are committed to keeping our home and the children in it as clean as possible to help minimize and/or prevent the spread of germs. Our home is kept clean and always disinfected. We thoroughly clean surfaces that children come in close contact with using soap and water, or Lysol, etc. The highchairs are cleaned between each use, and the diaper changing tables are cleaned and disinfected between each diaper change. Toys are cleaned and disinfected often, and water-play tables are cleaned and disinfected before being filled with water and carefully supervised when in use.

                <p>
                    Hand washing is the single most effective practice in preventing the spread of germs. We wash our hands many times throughout the day, as well as the children's hands before and/or after engaging in a thorough list of activities.

                <h2 class="section-title">Diaper Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    It is the parent’s responsibility to provide diapers, wipes, and diaper cream for your child. Diapers are checked frequently and changed every three hours or more often if required. Disposable changing mats are used to change diapers and are immediately discarded after each change and replaced with a new one. The diaper changing table is cleaned and disinfected between each diaper change, and hand washing of childcare provider and child is performed after each diaper change.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Toilet Training</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important factor in making the toilet learning experience successful and as low-stress as possible is a home/child care partnership that supports your child. Research indicates that children cannot successfully learn how to use the toilet until they are physically, psychologically, and emotionally ready. Many pediatricians say that most children under 24 months of age are not physically capable of regulating bladder and bowel muscles. Most positive toilet training occurs only after children show signs of physical control or awareness of their bodily functions and when they demonstrate an interest or curiosity in the process. We are committed to working with you to make sure that toilet training is carried out in a manner that is consistent with your child’s physical and emotional abilities and your family’s concerns.
