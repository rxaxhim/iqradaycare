                <h2 class="section-title">Learning Centres</h2>
                <p>
                    Our program aims to foster children's cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development through age-appropriate activities and learning centers, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Free Play Area:</strong> Opportunities for free play with educational toys, games, and puzzles to stimulate independent learning at the beginning of the day as we are waiting for everyone to arrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Library and Literacy Center:</strong> Circle Time will be the first activity of the day where the children will learn rhymes and listen to story books with the help of props. This section will also have a front-facing children's bookshelf if the kids want to read books on their own during the day. It will also involve finger plays, storytelling, creative dramatics, exercises, science, shapes, numbers, colors, alphabet, and much more through various monthly themes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outdoor Play Area:</strong> Supervised outdoor activities like climbing, sliding, jumping, running, balls, racing, parachute, catch, bubbles, follow the leader, squirt bottles, ride-on toys, wagons, tunnels, safe water toys, various games, water table, painting, neighborhood walks, exploring nature/weather, soccer, and yes falling. As you know, children play hard and will get some bumps and bruises from time to time. We do our best to limit the number of times this occurs, with constant supervision and watchful eyes. Due to the safe environment/toys we have surrounded ourselves with, we hope to prevent any injuries before they can happen. During the summer months (June, July, and August) we allow for more outdoor activities and creative art projects. Weather permitting, we play outdoors every day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nap Area / Calm Down Zone:</strong> Rest times are provided according to each child’s age and needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infant Play Area:</strong> A supervised playpen with infant-safe toys where babies can learn to play and explore independently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Centre:</strong> Structured and unstructured math and science learning. Mathematical activities will be aligned with fine motor skills milestones. Infants and toddlers learn through play by utilizing flash cards, books, blocks, abacus, numbers, puzzles, age-appropriate toys, and much more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative Center:</strong> An area which will be used for arts and craft, and to improve children's fine motor skills. We know that children learn best by “doing”. Therefore, the activities the children participate in are developmentally appropriate, concrete, hands-on, and most of all fun, because we believe that learning is an exciting experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gross Motor Area:</strong> Indoor physical activity center focused on the physical development of children. Throughout each day we practice on large and small motor skills by reaching, grasping, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, walking, climbing, throwing, catching, kicking, cooing, and talking; whichever developmental stage your child happens to be in at the time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dramatic Play Area:</strong> Self-guided learning using toys like play-kitchen, play-workshop, dress up, play food, stuffed animals, cars/trucks/planes, dolls, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Preschool Curriculum</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure our preschoolers are kindergarten-ready when they graduate from our program, we teach them using one of the most popular preschool curriculums: <strong>Lil Dreamers Dream Big</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Nap Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Younger infants can be given a third nap in the later afternoon if needed, and toddlers no longer requiring two naps a day will just take a single nap at 12:30 pm. Individual sleeping areas are provided with a mattress, blanket, and pillow, and are laundered weekly.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Daily Schedule</h2>
                <p>
                    This schedule is meant to give you an idea of your child’s day. Actual times and activities may vary depending on the time of the year, weather, age, and temperament of the children. Age-appropriate activities are scheduled with the flexibility allowed to respond to the needs of each individual child and their various ages.
